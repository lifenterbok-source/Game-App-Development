        <h1>Gaming App Development: Strategy for Selecting a Partner</h1>
    </header>

    <div class="container">
        <article>
            <p>The mobile gaming market continues to grow exponentially. However, the success of a gaming app depends not only on a brilliant idea but also on the quality of technical execution. Choosing a GameDev studio is a pivotal stage where most startups make fatal mistakes.</p>
            
            <p>In this article, we will analyze the technical and business criteria for selecting a contractor, avoiding generic advice and focusing on what truly impacts your project's ROI.</p>

            <h2>1. Tech Stack: Unity or Unreal?</h2>
            <p>The first question you must ask a potential partner is about their core technology. The choice of the engine determines performance, development speed, and maintenance costs.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Unity:</strong> The de facto standard for mobile games (iOS/Android). Ideal for 2D and lightweight 3D projects. Its massive community and asset store allow for a significantly reduced Time-to-Market.</li>
                <li><strong>Unreal Engine:</strong> The choice for AAA projects requiring high-fidelity graphics. If you plan a cross-platform release (PC + Consoles + Mobile), Unreal might be preferable, though development costs will be higher.</li>
                <li><strong>HTML5 / WebGL:</strong> Essential for browser-based games and Instant Games within messaging apps.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Portfolio Evaluation Criteria</h2>
            <p>Do not judge solely by beautiful visuals. When analyzing a company's case studies, pay attention to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Genre Expertise:</strong> If a studio has only produced hyper-casual games, they may lack the architecture skills required for a complex MMORPG.</li>
                <li><strong>LiveOps & Support:</strong> A game does not end at launch. Ask if the company has experience in post-launch operations, delivering updates, and analyzing user data.</li>
                <li><strong>Retention & Performance Metrics:</strong> Professionals can share anonymized success metrics of their projects (FPS stability, crash rates, retention benchmarks).</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h3>Crucial: Monetization Expertise</h3>
                <p>Code is only half the battle. A top-tier GameDev company must understand how to integrate In-App Purchases (IAP) and ad mediation (AdMob, IronSource) without ruining the user experience.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>3. Outstaffing vs. Outsourcing</h2>
            <p>When choosing a cooperation model, consider your internal resources:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Outsourcing (Project-based):</strong> You provide the specifications, and you receive a finished product. Best if you do not have an in-house CTO.</li>
                <li><strong>Outstaffing (Dedicated Team):</strong> You hire the studio's developers as temporary employees under your management. This requires strong leadership on your side but offers full control over the code.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Top 20 Companies: Market Overview</h2>
            <p>There are thousands of studios on the market—from indie teams to large enterprise integrators. Conducting independent research via Clutch, GoodFirms, and LinkedIn can take weeks. To simplify the search process, it is essential to rely on verified ratings that consider client reviews, project complexity, and pricing policies.</p>
            
            <p>For those looking for proven contractors with a confirmed reputation, we recommend reviewing the current market research.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Developing a gaming app is an investment with high risks and high potential returns. Do not try to cut costs on architecture and partner selection. A mistake at the beginning of the journey will cost exponentially more during the scaling phase.</p>
            <p>Analyze portfolios, demand transparent estimates, and choose teams that are as passionate about game development as you are.</p>
